module Shippinglogic
  class UPS
    # An interface to the track services provided by UPS. Allows you to get an array of events for a specific
    # tracking number.
    #
    # == Accessor methods / options
    #
    # * <tt>tracking_number</tt> - the tracking number
    #
    # === Simple Example
    #
    # Here is a very simple example:
    #
    #   ups = Shippinglogic::UPS.new(key, password, account)
    #   tracking_details = ups.track(:tracking_number => "my number")
    #
    #   tracking_details.status
    #   # => "Delivered"
    #
    #   tracking_details.signature_name
    #   # => "KKING"
    #
    #   tracking_details.events.first
    #   # => #<Shippinglogic::UPS::Track::Event @postal_code="95817", @name="Delivered", @state="CA",
    #   #     @city="Sacramento", @type="Delivered", @country="US", @occurred_at=Mon Dec 08 10:43:37 -0500 2008>
    #
    #   tracking_details.events.first.name
    #   # => "Delivered"
    #
    # === Note
    #
    # UPS does support locating packages through means other than a tracking number.
    # These are not supported and probably won't be until someone needs them. It should
    # be fairly simple to add, but I could not think of a reason why anyone would want to track
    # a package with anything other than a tracking number.
