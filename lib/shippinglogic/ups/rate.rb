module Shippinglogic
  class UPS
    # An interface to the rate services provided by UPS. Allows you to get an array of rates from UPS for a shipment,
    # or a single rate for a specific service.
    #
    # == Options
    # === Shipper options
    #
    # * <tt>shipper_name</tt> - name of the shipper.
    # * <tt>shipper_streets</tt> - street part of the address, separate multiple streets with a new line, dont include blank lines.
    # * <tt>shipper_city</tt> - city part of the address.
    # * <tt>shipper_state_</tt> - state part of the address, use state abreviations.
    # * <tt>shipper_postal_code</tt> - postal code part of the address. Ex: zip for the US.
    # * <tt>shipper_country</tt> - country code part of the address. UPS expects abbreviations, but Shippinglogic will convert full names to abbreviations for you.
    #
    # === Recipient options
    #
    # * <tt>recipient_name</tt> - name of the recipient.
    # * <tt>recipient_streets</tt> - street part of the address, separate multiple streets with a new line, dont include blank lines.
    # * <tt>recipient_city</tt> - city part of the address.
    # * <tt>recipient_state</tt> - state part of the address, use state abreviations.
    # * <tt>recipient_postal_code</tt> - postal code part of the address. Ex: zip for the US.
    # * <tt>recipient_country</tt> - country code part of the address. UPS expects abbreviations, but Shippinglogic will convert full names to abbreviations for you.
    # * <tt>recipient_residential</tt> - a boolean value representing if the address is redential or not (default: false)
    #
    # === Packaging options
    #
    # One thing to note is that UPS does support multiple package shipments. The problem is that all of the packages must be identical.
    # UPS specifically notes in their documentation that mutiple package specifications are not allowed. So your only option for a
    # multi package shipment is to increase the package_count option and keep the dimensions and weight the same for all packages. Then again,
    # the documentation for the UPS web services is terrible, so I could be wrong. Any tests I tried resulted in an error though.
    #
    # * <tt>packaging_type</tt> - one of PACKAGE_TYPES. (default: YOUR_PACKAGING)
    # * <tt>package_count</tt> - the number of packages in your shipment. (default: 1)
    # * <tt>package_weight</tt> - a single packages weight.
    # * <tt>package_weight_units</tt> - either LB or KG. (default: LB)
    # * <tt>package_length</tt> - a single packages length, only required if using YOUR_PACKAGING for packaging_type.
    # * <tt>package_width</tt> - a single packages width, only required if using YOUR_PACKAGING for packaging_type.
    # * <tt>package_height</tt> - a single packages height, only required if using YOUR_PACKAGING for packaging_type.
    # * <tt>package_dimension_units</tt> - either IN or CM. (default: IN)
    #
    # === Monetary options
    #
    # * <tt>currency_type</tt> - the type of currency. (default: nil, because UPS will default to your account preferences)
    # * <tt>insured_value</tt> - the value you want to insure, if any. (default: nil)
    # * <tt>payor_account_number</tt> - if the account paying for this ship is different than the account you specified then
    #   you can specify that here. (default: your account number)
    #
    # === Delivery options
    #
    # * <tt>service_type</tt> - one of SERVICE_TYPES, this is optional, leave this blank if you want a list of all
    #   available services. (default: nil)
    # * <tt>delivery_deadline</tt> - whether or not to include estimated transit times. (default: true)
    # * <tt>dropoff_type</tt> - one of DROP_OFF_TYPES. (default: REGULAR_PICKUP)
    #
    # === Misc options
    #
    # * <tt>documents_only</tt> - whether the package consists of only documents (default: false)
    #
    # == Simple Example
    #
    # Here is a very simple example. Mix and match the options above to get more accurate rates:
    #
    #   ups = Shippinglogic::UPS.new(key, password, account)
    #   rates = ups.rate(
    #     :shipper_postal_code => "10007",
    #     :shipper_country => "US",
    #     :recipient_postal_code => "75201",
    #     :recipient_country_code => "US",
    #     :package_weight => 24,
    #     :package_length => 12,
    #     :package_width => 12,
    #     :package_height => 12
    #   )
    #
    #   rates.first
    #   #<Shippinglogic::UPS::Rate::Service:0x10354d108 @currency="USD", @speed=nil,
    #     @rate=#<BigDecimal:10353ac10,'0.1885E2',18(18)>, @type="Ground", @name="Ground">
    #
    #   # to show accessor methods
    #   rates.first.name
    #   # => "Ground"
    class Rate < Service
      def self.path
        "/Rate"
      end

      # Each rate result is an object of this class
      class Service; attr_accessor :name, :type, :speed, :rate, :currency; end
